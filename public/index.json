To accomplish this, a cybersecurity homelab is a great project for new graduates to showcase their skills. A home lab, which is a smaller version of a commercial network, can be set up at home. In a risk-free setting, you can try out new technology, improve your abilities, and practice for real-life situations.\nHomelab Topology Setting Up a Centralized Active Directory Environment for a Homelab Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks, enabling centralized management of permissions and access controls. It operates on a hierarchical structure, consisting of a domain, a Domain Controller (DC), Organizational Units (OUs), a Forest, and Trusts. Each domain manages unique objects, enforces security policies, and stores user credentials and permissions. AD is essential for IT administrators in medium to large organizations.\nA centralized Active Directory environment is crucial for managing and organizing network resources, such as user accounts, computers, and security policies. By integrating AD into your homelab, you can gain hands-on experience with this critical technology, which is widely used in enterprise networks.\nPlanning Your Active Directory Setup To create a centralized Active Directory environment, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to carefully plan your setup. The key components of your homelab will include:\nMain PC: This is the central device that will host all your virtual machines and manage your homelab. For this project, I will be using Windows Server 2022 as our Main PC. Windows Server VM: This VM will run Windows Server and act as your Active Directory Domain Controller (DC). The DC is responsible for authenticating and authorizing all users and computers within your network domain. Workstations: These will be additional VMs running operating systems like Windows 10 and various Linux distributions. These workstations will join your AD domain and can be used to simulate employee computers in a business network. Configuring the IP Address Open the \u0026ldquo;Network and Sharing Center\u0026rdquo; and click on \u0026ldquo;Change adapter settings\u0026rdquo;: Right-click on your network connection (Ethernet0) and select \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Ethernet Properties\u0026rdquo; window, select \u0026ldquo;Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo;.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Use the following IP address\u0026rdquo; and enter your desired IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses:\nIP Address: 192.168.16.3 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.16.1 Preferred DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) Installing Updates Go to \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Update \u0026amp; Security\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Windows Update\u0026rdquo;. Check for and install all available updates to ensure your server is up-to-date. After installing the update, restart your server. This concludes the static IP assignment for the Main PC (AD DS). The next steps would be setting up DNS and DHCP in Active Directory.\nSetting Up DNS and DHCP in Active Directory DNS in Active Directory DNS resolution services enable customers to locate Domain Controllers and for the Domain Controllers hosting directory services to interact with each other. AD locates items within it using DNS.\nConfiguring DNS in AD will require a reverse lookup zone. Designed mostly for resolving IP addresses to network resource names, a reverse lookup zone is an authoritative DNS zone. Without setting a reverse lookup zone, you cannot map IP addresses within the zone to the hostname.\nDHCP in Active Directory While still under direct control from the Domain Controller with AD installed, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lets the Domain Controller send out IP addressing information so that clients can communicate with other computers and services.\nThis is why you will have to install and set DNS and DHCP in AD to enable the whole procedure to run smoothly.\nSteps to Configure DNS and DHCP in Active Directory Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS\nOpen Server Manager, click Manage, and select Add Roles and Features. Select Active Directory Domain Services, add required features, and proceed with the installation. Click the Flag icon in Server Manager and select Promote this server to a domain controller. Add a new forest, enter your domain name (e.g., yourdomain.local), and complete the wizard. Configure a Reverse Lookup Zone\nOpen DNS Manager from the Tools menu in Server Manager. Right-click on Reverse Lookup Zones and select New Zone. Follow the wizard to create a new reverse lookup zone. Install and Configure DHCP\nOpen Server Manager, click Manage, and select Add Roles and Features. Select DHCP Server and proceed with the installation. After installation, click Complete DHCP Configuration. Open DHCP Manager, right-click IPv4, and select New Scope. Enter the IP range and complete the wizard. By following these steps, you will set up a functioning Domain Controller with DNS and DHCP, ensuring efficient network management and seamless device integration.\nTesting Your Active Directory Setup and Services I wanted to check if everything worked after effectively following and completing the first configurations and setup for AD on the Windows Server 2022 VM. I first downloaded a Windows 10 Enterprise Edition virtual machine to accomplish this. I was able to achieve this after researching how I could configure Windows to acquire IP addresses from the WS-22, primary PC.\nSummary In this part of the Cybersecurity Homelab project, we learned what Active Directory is, why we use it, and how it links to cybersecurity. We also learned how to set up AD for a home lab environment with DNS and DHCP, as well as how to test and connect a Windows 10 Enterprise Edition to the network. In the next part of this project, I will set up basic RDP servers and install and connect Linux and Windows 10 machines.\n","permalink":"https://www.obsanmuzemil.com/posts/projects/cyber-homelab/","summary":"An overview of setting up a Cybersecurity Homelab for practice and learning.","title":"Cyber HomeLab"},{"content":"Homelab Project # List all files in a directory ls -la # Change directory cd /path/to/directory # Display the current directory pwd ### 3. **Code Block for PowerShell Commands** Similarly, for PowerShell commands, specify the language as `powershell`: ```markdown ```powershell # Get the list of processes Get-Process # List files in a directory Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\ # Display system information Get-ComputerInfo ### 4. **Using Hugo\u0026#39;s Highlight Shortcode** You can also use Hugo\u0026#39;s internal highlight shortcode to add these command blocks, which allows you to include additional options like line numbers: #### Linux Commands: ```markdown # List all files in a directory ls -la # Change directory cd /path/to/directory # Display the current directory pwd ","permalink":"https://www.obsanmuzemil.com/posts/htb/","summary":"Homelab Project # List all files in a directory ls -la # Change directory cd /path/to/directory # Display the current directory pwd ### 3. **Code Block for PowerShell Commands** Similarly, for PowerShell commands, specify the language as `powershell`: ```markdown ```powershell # Get the list of processes Get-Process # List files in a directory Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\ # Display system information Get-ComputerInfo ### 4. **Using Hugo\u0026#39;s Highlight Shortcode** You can also use Hugo\u0026#39;s internal highlight shortcode to add these command blocks, which allows you to include additional options like line numbers: #### Linux Commands: ```markdown # List all files in a directory ls -la # Change directory cd /path/to/directory # Display the current directory pwd ","title":"Htb"},{"content":"Hello and welcome to my website\nThis site is a personal project where I showcase various aspects of my interests, skills, and ongoing projects.
